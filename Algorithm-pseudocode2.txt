Algorithm 1:
To list the students with total marks less than a certain threshold.
1. Create a function StudentMarksThreshold with void return type.
2. Initialize a vairable "threshold" as double.

Function StudentsMarksThreshold(threshold):
3. Creating a message to inform the user of the threshold value.
4. for each student in students:
        if student.getTotalMark() < threshold:
        print student name, student id and total mark marks.            
        
In the main function of the program.
5. Prompt the user to provide "threshold" as double and read the value and store it.
6. Threshold value is passed as argument to the StudentsMarksThreshold method when the class studentStats is called.
studentStats.StudentsMarksThreshold(threshold)
7.End



Algorithm 2:
To print top5 and bottom 5 student marks.
1.Create a function named TopAndBottomStudentsMarks().
TopAndBottomStudentsMarks()

2.Create an empty list called topStudents and bottomStudents
3.For each student in students:
       if size of topStudents is less than 5:
       Then, add entire student object to topStudentslist.
       else:
            For i from 0 to size of topStudents - 1:
                If student.getTotalMark() > topStudents[i].getTotalMark():
                    Insert the entire student object at index i in topStudents.
                    Remove student object at index 5 in topStudents.
                    Break the loop.

4.If size of bottomStudents is less than 5:
        Then, add entire student object to bottomStudents
        else:
            For i from 0 to size of bottomStudents - 1:
                If student.getTotalMark() < bottomStudents[i].getTotalMark():
                    Insert the entire student object at index i in bottomStudents.
                    Remove the student object  at index 5 in bottomStudents.
                    Break the loop.

4. Create printStudents function to print the Student Name,id and total mark.
5. Call printstudents function with topStudents and bottomstudents as value and display the result.
In the main Program:
6. Call the TopAndBottomStudentsMarks function.
studentStats.TopAndBottomStudentsMarks();
7.End
